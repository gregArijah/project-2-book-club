       ("Don Quixote","Miguel de Cervantes","If you don't know what it means to tilt at windmills, then you owe it to yourself to cross Don Quixote off your reading bucket list. This 17th century treasure follows a nobleman who has lost his mind and proceeds to have insane adventures in the name of chivalry. "),

White","If you somehow made it through childhood without reading Charlotte's Web—or if you did, but no longer remember it—stop what you're doing and pick up a copy of this book. A regular essayist for the New Yorker and the co-author of The Elements of Style, a guide that will likely never leave syllabi for college writing courses, no one writes like E.B. White. ");
